Log-Any-Adapter-Dupstd

Adapters Dupstd are intended to log messages into duplicates of standard
descriptors STDOUT and STDERR.

Logging into a duplicate of standard descriptor might be needed in special
occasions when you need to redefine or even close standard descriptor but you
want to continue displaying messages wherever they are displayed by a standard
descriptor.
